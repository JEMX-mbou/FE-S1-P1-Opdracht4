      <h1 id="page-title">11 Most Influential & Greatest Programmers of All Time.</h1>
      <p>The other day when I was trying to fix a bug in one of the applications I was working on, I was really frustrated with myself as the fix was really easy (I missed some configuration but for some reason, the logs were not printing the error). I wasted 25 minutes on it. After the code fix, I wondered what if I was sitting with one of the Greatest Programmers of all time (hypothetically), how much time would they have taken to find the root cause.</p>

          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p><em>1 minute?… 30 seconds?… 1 second?</em></p>
          <p>Programming is a skill. It’s an art for some. Some people just code for hours to relieve their stress. While others express their emotions by developing applications. Some create solutions to the most complex problems out there. The fact that ideas can be transitioned to reality via programming always fascinated me.</p>
          <p>Here’s a list of the programmers (in no particular order) who pioneered the computing world and changed the way we access information today.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="dennis_ritchie">
          <h2>Dennis Ritchie</h2>
          <p>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist who created the C programming language along with his long-time colleague, Ken Thomson. He is credited for shaping and pioneering the digital era. Today, C programming is used in several software applications, embedded system development, operating systems, and has influenced most modern programming languages.</p>
          <p>Richie also co-created the UNIX operating system along with Ken Thomson. For his work, in 1983 he received the Turing Award from the ACM, the Hamming Medal in 1990 from the IEEE and in 1999 the National Medal of Technology from President Clinton. He   was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.</p>

          <p>Sir Timothy John “Tim” Berners-Lee also known as “TimBL,” is a British computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is also credited for the implementation of the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in 1989.</p>
          <p>Berners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours “for services to the global development of the Internet” and was invested formally on 16 July 2004. He is also the holder of the Founders Chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>

          <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish–American software engineer who is the creator and, historically, the main developer of the Linux kernel. He also created Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Currently, he works as the project coordinator.</p>
          <p>Torvalds was honoured with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland because of his creation of a new open-source operating system for computers leading to the widespread use of the Linux kernel.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
          <h2>Closing statement</h2>
          <p>Well, here are some of the most influential programmers of all time for me. Some other programmers deserve also honourable mention — Ada Lovelace, Bill Gates, Richard Stallman, Niklaus Wirth, Satoshi Nakamoto, John Carmack, Jeff Dean, Martin Odesrky, Drew Houston, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey. I am sure this list would be different for you.</p>
          <p>I have also included Jon Skeet in the list even though he didn’t create a programming language or framework but he has helped to build the developer community of what we know today. Also, I have used his solution (from StackOverflow) to fix my configuration change mentioned at the beginning. No wonder Skeet is known as the Chuck Norris of Programming.</p>
